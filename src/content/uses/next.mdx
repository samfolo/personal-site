description: What I'm exploring and planning to learn.

One of the first things I did once I had Ollama up and running was pull in `qwen3:32b`. I asked Qwen to build a game of snake, just to see what I was working with... within a few turns I had a functional prototype. These weren't frontier models, but I immediately saw the potential.

I've been working on a side project against the pay-to-play APIs that I'm in the process of converting to work with local models – I'm looking forward to wrapping everything in a set of evals and getting a feel for the capabilities of these models as distillation and quantisation approaches improve over the year. I saw the FunctionGemma announcement at the end of 2025 and knew I'd made the right decision. I can't wait to figure all this stuff out.
