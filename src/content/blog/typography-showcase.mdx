This article showcases all the typographic elements available in the prose styling system. It serves as a reference for reviewing heading hierarchy, paragraph spacing, and other text elements.

## Second level heading

This is body text following an H2. The heading should be clearly distinguished from the body copy whilst maintaining visual harmony with the overall design.

Paragraphs have comfortable spacing that aids readability without creating visual fragmentation. The line height is set to allow the eye to flow naturally from one line to the next.

### Third level heading

H3 headings provide an additional level of hierarchy beneath H2. They're useful for breaking down sections into more granular topics without the visual weight of an H2.

Here we have another paragraph demonstrating the relationship between headings and body copy. Notice how the spacing adjusts to create clear associations between headings and their content.

#### Fourth level heading

H4 headings offer yet another level of subdivision. At this level, the visual distinction becomes more subtle, relying more on weight than size.

##### Fifth level heading

H5 headings are quite rare in practice, but available when deeply nested content requires them.

###### Sixth level heading

H6 represents the final level of heading hierarchy. It's styled distinctively with uppercase letters and muted colour to differentiate it from regular body text whilst remaining subordinate to all other heading levels.

## Text styling

Beyond headings, prose supports various inline text styles:

- **Bold text** draws attention to key terms and makes them stand out
- _Italic text_ provides emphasis or indicates titles
- `Inline code` displays technical terms or file names
- [Links to other pages](/blog) connect to related content

Here's an example of **bold text within a sentence** to demonstrate how it draws the eye. The emphasis colour is slightly brighter than regular text, making important terms more noticeable without being distracting.

Links like [this one to the about page](/about) or [external links](https://example.com) use a subtle hover animation that sweeps across the text, creating a delightful interaction.

### Lists and structure

Unordered lists work well for:

- Items without inherent sequence
- Feature lists
- Quick bullet points

Ordered lists are better for:

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Ranked items
3. Sequential processes

### Code blocks

Code blocks display with appropriate styling:

```typescript
interface TypographyConfig {
  fontFamily: string;
  scale: number;
  baseSize: number;
}

function calculateSize(level: number, config: TypographyConfig): number {
  return config.baseSize * Math.pow(config.scale, level);
}
```

### Quotations

> Good typography is invisible. It doesn't draw attention to itself but rather serves the content, guiding the reader through the text with clarity and purpose.

Blockquotes set important passages apart from regular text, drawing the eye and providing visual breathing room.

Horizontal rules create clear breaks between major sections, useful when a heading would be inappropriate or when marking a significant tonal shift.

## Conclusion

This showcase demonstrates the complete typographic system. Each element has been carefully considered to create a cohesive reading experience that works across different content types and lengths.
