This post explores the architecture behind a dual-agent system designed for semantic parsing tasks.

## The problem with single-agent approaches

When building systems that need to understand and execute complex instructions, a single agent often struggles with both interpretation and execution simultaneously. The cognitive load of doing both at once leads to errors and inconsistencies.

## Introducing the dual-agent pattern

By separating concerns between two specialised agents, we can achieve better results:

1. **Understanding Agent** - Focuses purely on semantic interpretation
2. **Execution Agent** - Handles the mechanical aspects of task completion

This separation allows each agent to be optimised for its specific role.

## Implementation details

The key insight is that each agent can be tuned independently, leading to more reliable outputs overall.

```typescript
// Example of agent coordination
const understanding = await understandingAgent.parse(input);
const result = await executionAgent.execute(understanding);
```

The understanding agent produces an intermediate representation that the execution agent can work with deterministically. This makes debugging significantly easier.

> The best systems are often those that break complex problems into simpler, well-defined subtasks.

More details on the implementation will follow in future posts.
