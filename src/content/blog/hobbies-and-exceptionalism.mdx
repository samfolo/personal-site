I walked about 90 minutes up to Stratford to find a spot that would "inspire"
me enough to write this post. I stood in line for another 20 minutes at a
coffee shop because my laptop had run out of caffeine. I sat for about 30
minutes before writing a single word that actually made it into this post. It
will likely be no better because of it.

In the morning, on the day of writing, I had a clear vision for what I wanted
to say; for as long as I can remember, I'd always grouped activities into three
categories: those in which I create, those in which I consume, and those in
which I participate. When I take stock of all the hobbies that have captured my
attention over time, I find they all had something in common: I'd first been
obsessed with the end-result and how it made me feel.

The process itself was never the first point of attraction—there was always a
moment I could recall where I saw the reaction of someone I either knew,
respected or otherwise cared about when engaging with the outcome. I hear
people speak all the time about the moment they saw someone else doing
something they loved and how that moment inspired them to pursue something
similar, but I have no moments like that to recall. If I saw that the end
result was a vehicle for connection, I'd find the motivation to learn the craft
itself; the deeper I understood it, the wider my vocabulary, the more precisely
I could express ideas, the more effectively I could communicate. Before I knew
it, I would be years deep into understanding some tool or paradigm, driven by
the promise of being able to express an old idea that much more clearly the
next time I tried.

Some time last year, a friend I were approach our 5th hour of wandering round
London's city centre when the conversation turned to early-2000s games. The
last time we had seen eachother was at an arcade, so I should have guessed that
videogames were a large part of his life. While he seemed to know every title I
mentioned, I still surprised myself as to how many I could name—I'd never
considered myself a gamer, but apparently they were a huge part of my
childhood. For my friend, games were one of his primary hobbies; for me,
well... I'd never really considered gaming as a hobby at all—maybe I thought
that because I didn't ever think I was good enough to claim that identity for
myself, or maybe because I didn't really consider it "valid" in the first
place. Hobbies were meant to be productive; they were meant to result in
something... to invoke some sort of emotion or reaction in a person or a
group... to forge some sort of connection. *Making* games seemed to check all
those boxes, but playing them felt different somehow.

I'd never had a relationship to sports... I felt something I could only
describe as retroactive resentment when I finally found running. All of a
sudden every free pass I'd been given to skip an opportunity to connect with
others over sport seemed like a missed opportunity. There's always a quiet discomfort that comes with learning something new about something I thought I understood... a tiny reminder that I've been walking around blind in some way, and all this time. I can't even enjoy the newfound enlightenment because I'm too busy wondering how many [people saw me stumble about like...]
