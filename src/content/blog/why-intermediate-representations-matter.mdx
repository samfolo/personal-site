One of the most powerful patterns in building reliable AI systems is the introduction of intermediate representations.

## The direct approach problem

Many AI systems attempt to go directly from user input to final action. This creates brittleness and makes debugging difficult. When something goes wrong, you have no visibility into where the failure occurred.

## Introducing intermediate layers

Consider this pipeline:

1. **User Intent** - Raw natural language input
2. **Semantic Representation** - Structured understanding of what the user wants
3. **Execution Plan** - Concrete steps to achieve the goal
4. **Actions** - Actual system operations

Each layer provides an opportunity for validation and correction.

## Benefits

The advantages of this approach are substantial:

- **Debuggability** - You can inspect each layer to understand where issues arise
- **Testability** - Each transformation can be tested in isolation
- **Flexibility** - Swap implementations at any layer without affecting others
- **Observability** - Log intermediate states for analysis

## A practical example

Rather than asking an AI to "send an email to John about the meeting", you might:

1. Parse intent: `{ action: "send_email", recipient: "John", topic: "meeting" }`
2. Resolve references: `{ action: "send_email", recipient: "john@example.com", topic: "Q4 planning meeting" }`
3. Generate content and execute

This pattern has proven invaluable in production systems where reliability is paramount.
