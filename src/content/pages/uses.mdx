## Then

From the moment I got my hands on Logic Pro 9, Macbooks have been my default. Some time around 2010 an older friend of mine lent me theirs for a weekend – he wanted me to make some changes to something he was working on. He had gotten me into music production a few years earlier; I’d been using FL Studio 7 on Windows since he gave me his copy in 2006.

I started to experiment with third-party plug-ins as I ventured deeper into music production – my first industry-grade suite was Native Instruments Komplete 9. After years of squeezing every bit of realism I could out of the stock plug-ins that came with the DAW, I suddenly had access to a substrate of realistic, synthetic sounds I could use to craft layered, multi-dimensional pieces. NI-9’s Session Horns Pro is where my appreciation for big brass came from.

Next came depth and timbre: I discovered the world of algorithmic and convolutional reverbs; I layered rich sampled drums over focused synthetic ones; I drowned naive string sections in expensive-sounding room emulations. I learned about how our hearing evolved to be extra-sensitive around 2KHz because it helps us pick out the human voice against the backdrop of nature... how carving that space out with an EQ was how songs on the radio made those lead vocals sit clear amidst all the chaos.

Soon, the things I wanted to create were constrained by the tools that I had available; the projects I had spent weeks on refused to open any more.

I discovered RAM... and how little I had.

In 2012, I bought my first computer part, two sticks of 8Gb DDR3 RAM, back when Apple products had screws and seams. My sole requirement for personal computers became as much RAM as possible – RAM meant I could create, and that’s all that mattered.

Fast forward to 2014, the heart of my Liverpool studio setup was a 27” iMac. It had 32Gb of RAM – I made sure of that – and was supported by 2 LaCie rugged drives and an Allianz insurance policy. None of the other specs mattered to me: I could run Logic Pro X, I could create.

I ran a number of vocal chains in that studio, but a Neumann u87ai through an Avalon 737 was the main one. It would be a year before I even knew what to do with a chain like that.

When I moved back to London in 2019, I took it all with me; the iMac stayed the heart of the small studio I ran out of [BSMNT](https://www.bsmnt.net) for about 8 months in North London. That was the prettiest my setup ever looked – shout out, Phillips Hue.

## Now

At the end of 2025, I was in the market for something more current. The iMac was now about 12 years old, Apple had stopped supporting the model years ago, and I’d had to restore it from backups at least twice. I’d been talking to my cousins overseas about their own setups; they’re both gamers and one of them had been into custom builds for a while.

At this point I knew several people from work who had built their own custom PCs, most of them long ago... they had taken different paths to mine, and were already deep in the world of Cherry MX switches and Arduinos by the time I arrived. My dad used to build PCs, actually, when I was very young – I remember sitting at the back of his homelab playing Beyond Good and Evil, Etherena Beta, alongside a few incredible titles my brother and I found at the bottom of bargain bins in Camden.

I used Linux/Ubuntu at work and had gotten pretty comfortable with it over the years, but everything was managed – I’d never been sure if it was actually that approachable, or whether the sysadmins had hidden the sharp edges from me. I had some down time, so instead of buying another MacBook Pro, I saw December as an opportunity to build my own PC from scratch.

The way I use a computer has changed drastically since entering tech; today I typically run tmux via WezTerm with a vertical split: one side flickering between NeoVim and the command line, the other running Claude Code. For theming, I switch between Tokyonight (the LazyVim default), Rose Pine and Kanagawa Wave.

I learned Vim out of sheer curiosity a year before; those first few weeks learning Vim bindings were **brutal**, but I stayed consistent and it paid off big time. If you’ve ever thought about it, do it – I promise you will get faster, and even faster than that.

For the build, I wanted to craft something that would let me explore the areas of technology that most excited me moving into 2026. Like many others, I had started playing around with AI through chat interfaces, but soon found myself wanting to experiment with models via APIs. Working with these cloud-based frontier models isn’t like learning a new framework… I couldn’t pay my way into understanding with my time like I did with music, or even coding. Every API request cost real money, and those 10,000 hours weren’t going to pay for themselves.

I had heard about the Llama models, but had no idea what the difference was between those and something like GPT-4… I forget exactly when I discovered there were models you could run locally, but I knew that was going to be the key to figuring things out without resenting the process.

I saw a lot of recommendations to “build around the GPU” online – after a tonne of research on what exactly I’d need to run this stuff locally for the next year or two, I made the choice to “build around” an RTX 5090.

What else did I need... a CPU? Understood. Some RAM? I knew that one. A motherboard… okay? ...thermal paste? Why do I need paste?

Eventually I had collated the full list, so I sought out a second opinion. My cousin brought it to my attention that I was building a cyborg.

I decided to go with Pop!\_OS for this machine – I’ve become comfortable with Linux, and Pop! lets me focus on creating things. Putting all the pieces together was mentally and physically satisfying. It took about a day and a half for me to finish it; knowing the purpose of every part really changes how you engage with the whole. I decided on a Keychron K3 Max keyboard, and stuck with a Magic Trackpad for comfort.

## Next

One of the first things I did once I had Ollama up and running was pull in `qwen3:32b`. I asked Qwen to build a game of snake, just to see what I was working with… within a few turns I had a functional prototype. These weren’t frontier models, but I immediately saw the potential.

I’ve been working on a side project against the pay-to-play APIs that I’m in the process of converting to work with local models – I’m looking forward to wrapping everything in a set of evals and getting a feel for the capabilities of these models as distillation and quantisation approaches improve over the year. I saw the FunctionGemma announcement at the end of 2025 and knew I’d made the right decision. I can’t wait to figure all this stuff out.
