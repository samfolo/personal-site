The journey I’ve taken so far might say otherwise, but I don’t think I’ve
changed much.

I still welcome boredom when it arrives; I’ve found there's
always something interesting waiting on the other side.

I don’t like to rush... though once I’m sure, I make decisions quickly. I care
**deeply** about details and I love deliberating over them.

I love discovering new ways to connect and communicate: protocols, standards,
specifications, symbolism­, algorithms, SDKs, colour palettes, plugins. I love
classic lyricism and A-A-B-A Jazz standards. I like being around people who are
proud to like what they like.

When I was younger, I found it was easiest to connect through music; I spent
years toying with VSTs and audio plugins, learning how to pore over a sentence
until the words sat perfectly. I learned what compression was and how it let
you get closer; I learned about mid-side processing and how there was always a
way to find room for a good thing. It took a while until something resonated,
but I kept putting things out into the ether. Enough years passed and I got
better.  Getting better often takes time and deliberate practice; the promise
of reception on the other side was always enough motivation to push forward.

I hated university, but I loved living in Liverpool. I remember sitting in my
dorm room watching full lectures on music production online instead of going to
the ones I was actually paying to attend. By 2017 I had a record deal and was
travelling around Europe and the UK. I wish I could describe what it feels like
to travel the world doing something you taught yourself from scratch in your
childhood bedroom. You come out of it with a deep respect for craft.

In 2019, I was sitting in my studio in London, half-way through a 3 hour
YouTube video about something called CSS. I had the video playing through a
pair of speakers I had owned for almost a year, next to a synth I had dreamed
of owning for far longer, barely following along. To this day I still choose
the longer videos because that’s how I learn: absorb as much data as possible,
build badly, wring the world dry for answers, until one day you wake up and the
concepts click... not always in line with common understanding, but in ways
that work for me. Always a deep, *resounding* click.

Two years later, after a lifetime of `final_final_v2_final.psd`, I discovered
semantic versioning.  A year after that, I learned what compression was for the
second time.

I built this site at the end of 2025, after about six years as a software
engineer in London. I picked a stack and shipped. I found myself deliberating
over which theme I should pick for the design system and couldn’t decide, so I
picked 4. 

I’ve learned a lot so far... particularly about how much there is to know in
this space. I’ve built some pretty cool things on and off the clock that I’m
eager to talk about. I learned the power of understanding “the user” and how
it’s another way I can connect with people.

I see how fast everything is changing at the moment – how the craft I feel I’ve
just settled into seems to be swallowing the world all over again – yet I’ve
never felt more creative in my life. More recently, I’ve been exploring agentic
systems and generative UI. From January 2026 I’ll be a Senior Product Engineer
at [Attio](https://attio.com), working on AI-native CRM.

I’m proud to say that I’ve remained curious.
